# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

In this hackathon, me and my teammate used the Unsplash API to build an application for searching and displaying images. We were focusing on building the search functionality, displaying image results, and showcasing author details. Extra feature such as pagination of the author's portfolio was also added.
