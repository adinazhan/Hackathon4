**Image Search Hackathon**

In this hackathon, me and my teammate used the Unsplash API to build an application for searching and displaying images. We were focusing on building the search functionality, displaying image results, and showcasing author details. Extra feature such as pagination of the author's portfolio was also added. 

This project uses Vite. After cloning, install the dependencies and run the development server.
